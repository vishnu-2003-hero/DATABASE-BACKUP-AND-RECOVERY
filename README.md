## As part of my internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS, I executed a comprehensive backup and recovery workflow for SQL-based databases to ensure business continuity and data resilience in case of system failure or corruption.
Key Activities and Outcomes:
-  Backup Strategy: Implemented full and incremental backup plans using SQL scripts and built-in database utilities (mysqldump for MySQL and pg_dump for PostgreSQL)
-  Automated Scripts: Created Python scripts to schedule and manage regular backups with timestamping and log tracking
-  Data Storage Optimization: Stored backups in compressed formats and verified their integrity through checksum validation
-  Disaster Recovery Simulation: Demonstrated end-to-end restoration from backup files, validating schema accuracy and row-level data recovery
-  Integrity Testing: Compared pre- and post-restore datasets to ensure no data loss, corruption, or type mismatch during recovery
This task enhanced my skills in preventive database maintenance, real-time recovery execution, and scripting for automationâ€”all critical for maintaining data reliability in enterprise systems.
